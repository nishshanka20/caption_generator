This precise timing ensures that the engine's valves open and close at the correct moments in relation to the piston's movement. A key distinction is the material: timing belts are made of a reinforced rubber composite and require replacement at specified intervals (e.g., every 60,000-100,000 miles), while timing chains are metal and designed to last the life of the engine, though they can stretch or their tensioners can fail over time. The most critical consideration is whether the vehicle has an 'interference' engine. On these engines, a failed belt or chain can cause the pistons to collide with the open valves, resulting in catastrophic and expensive engine damage. This makes adhering to the replacement schedule paramount for interference engines."

Its primary function is to act as a chemical catalyst, converting harmful exhaust pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into less harmful substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), and water (H2O). Inside the converter is a honeycomb-like substrate, typically ceramic, which is coated with a wash of precious metals—platinum, palladium, and rhodium—that facilitate the chemical reactions. Because of the high value of these metals, catalytic converters are unfortunately a common target for theft. Key features to consider when replacing one are whether it is a direct-fit model designed for a specific vehicle, or a universal one that requires welding and modification. A failing converter can cause reduced engine performance, a 'rotten egg' smell from the exhaust, and will trigger a check engine light, often with the diagnostic trouble code P0420."

Its function is to supply fuel at a specific volume, measured in liters per hour (LPH), and at a constant operating pressure, measured in PSI, to ensure the fuel injectors can operate correctly. A failing fuel pump presents several distinct symptoms, including difficulty starting the engine, hesitation or sputtering during acceleration, a distinct whining noise from the rear of the vehicle where the tank is located, or a complete loss of power. The fuel pump is often part of a larger module that includes the fuel level sending unit, which is the sensor that reports the fuel level to the dashboard gauge."

Each axle shaft has two CV joints: an inner joint connecting to the transmission and an outer joint connecting to the wheel. The most common point of failure is not the joint itself, but the flexible rubber boot that protects it. This boot holds lubricating grease in and keeps dirt and moisture out. Once the boot tears, the grease is flung out and contaminants enter, quickly causing the joint to wear out and fail. The classic tell-tale sign of a failing outer CV joint is a rhythmic clicking or popping sound that is most prominent when making sharp turns."

The Engine Control Unit (ECU) relies heavily on this data to calculate the precise amount of fuel to inject, ensuring the optimal air-fuel ratio for clean combustion and efficient performance. Most MAF sensors are of the 'hot wire' or 'hot film' type; they work by heating a small electronic element and then measuring the electrical current required to maintain its temperature as air flows past and cools it. When a MAF sensor becomes dirty or fails, it can send inaccurate data to the ECU, leading to a host of problems like a rough idle, engine hesitation or stalling, poor acceleration, and a noticeable decrease in fuel economy. Often, a specific check engine light code will be stored, and sometimes the sensor can be carefully cleaned to restore its function before a full replacement is necessary."
